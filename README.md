# Sortings

Simple sorting implementation in python

This project implemneted following sorting methods. 

1. Bubble Sort :: 
    O(n^2) - Time Complexity, 
    Inplace - No need of extra memory for saving sorted array, 
    Stable  - Equal values maintain order from original array
 
2. Selection Sort :: 
    O(n^2), 
    Inplace, 
    Not Stable
  
3. Insertion Sort ::
    O(n^2), 
    Stable, 
    Inplace, 
    Adaptive - Works fast for paratially sorted array
  
4. Quick Sort ::
    O(n log n), 
    Not Stable, 
    Inplace
  
5. Merge Sort :: 
    O(n log n), 
    Stable, 
    Not a Inplace, 
    Best choice for linkedlist sorting
